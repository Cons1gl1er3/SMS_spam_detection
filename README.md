## Installation

Required packages: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, skikit-learn, pipeline, nltk, hyperopt

## Usage

Run the main.html file to test on our web interface. Since the spam messages in the training data are quite long, it is recommended to use text of 20-word or more.

We deploy and train data using 6 different settings (3 models x 2 feature extraction techniques) and perform hyperparameter tuning within the Notebook.ipynb file. You can also find some data visualization there.
